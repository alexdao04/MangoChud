# MangoChud: What is it?
MangoChud is a discord bot built off of discord.py v2.5.2. I primarily have this bot set up in a private server with my friends where we play games.
It's a long-term project that will be fleshed out over time during summer 2025.

I chose the name because I like mangoes, I like Indian food, my best friends in college are indian, and mango chudney just sounded like a good name.
What can I say? I get hungry at night, man..

TODO: establish basic command functionality after v0.1, target for v1.0 at some point
