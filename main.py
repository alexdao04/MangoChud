# MangoChud v0.1: A bot originally conceived for the Mango Chudney discord server.
# This bot is a general-purpose server bot for moderation, role assignment, fun interactions, and more.

# I built this bot using the discord.py library, a Python wrapper that makes Discord API calls easy.
# This bot is by "Alexander Dao" (me), and is open source under MIT license.

# probably not the best way to do this, but the interpreter and the framework was bitching about it
# so we just catch the error like patching flex tape on a leaking boat

# this logs messages to a file called discord.log
# logs bot activity, errors, etc (probably not gonna touch this for now)

# that makes it like 1000x easier to manage permissions rather than handling it in back end code

# we set the command prefix to '/' so that we can use commands like /assign, /

    # calls a premade function that processes any speech containing this keyword
    # the reaction role message id, which is a message that has a reaction role
    # is hardcoded here, so if you change the message id, you need to change it here too

# this is where the commands are defined. we're going to structure this in a way
# that we can find everything easily when we need to edit it later.
# admittedly, i'm tempted to set the main.py up so that it jumps to other files
# e.g. commands.py, events.py, etc. but for now, we keep this in one file until the need arises

# TODO: what we want to do here is assign a role to a user when they react to a message
# treat it like it's integrated into the server at the moment as a functionality (and left in main.py)
# but when this bot is expanded to work on multiple servers, we can move this to a separate file
